# Movie-Recommendation-System

The increasing importance of the Web as a medium for electronic and business transactions has served as a driving force 
for the development of recommender systems technology. 
An important catalyst in this regard is the ease with which the Web enables users to provide feedback about their likes or dislikes.
For example, consider a scenario of a content provider such as Netflix. 
In such cases, users are able to easily provide feedback with a simple click of a mouse. A typical methodology to provide feedback is in the form of ratings,
in which users select numerical values from a specific evaluation system (e.g., five-star rating system)
that specify their likes and dislikes of various items.

In this project I'm trying to give an introduction to how to create a simple movie recommendation system (collaborative and content-based)
while explaining the integral role of linear algebra and machine learning in this process.
